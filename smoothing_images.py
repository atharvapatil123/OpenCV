# Homogeneous filter is the most simple, each output filter is mean of the kernel neighbour, all pixels contribute equal weight, so homogeneous

# Gaussian filter is using different-weight-kernel in both x and y direction, pixels in the middle have higher wts and goes on decreasing in outward direction. Designed specifically to remove high noise.

#Median Filter: Replaces each pixel's value with the median of it neighbouring pixels. This method is great when dealing with "salt and pepper noise": white + black noise.

#Bilateral Filter: Destroys the noise but not the edges unlike the above filters

# Low Pass Filter: Helps is removing noises, blurring images
# high Pass Filters: Helps in finding edges in the images.
