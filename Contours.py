But actually do we need all the points? For eg, you found the contour of a straight line. Do you need all the points on the line to represent that line? No, we need just two end points of that line. This is what cv.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE does. It removes all redundant points and compresses the contour, thereby saving memory.)

#Here, CONTOURS: It is a python list of all contours in the image. Each individual contour is a numpy array of (x,y) coordinates of boundaary points of the object.
